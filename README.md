## Python Programming Assignments

![](machinelearning.jpg)

These are my solutions to the programming assignments done in Python of the Machine Learning course taught by Andrew Ng.

I forked [dibgerge's ml-coursera-python-assignments](https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments) repository to do the programming assignments in Python. This repository has the instructions re-written for Python and allows the assignments to be graded and submitted to the coursera platform.
